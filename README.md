# Predicting Photovoltaic Energy Production Performance
# Overview
The goal of this Data Science project is to **develop a predictive model** capable of estimating PV energy production with high accuracy. By doing so, the organization will improve resource allocation, maintenance scheduling, and power delivery reliability.

# Business Understanding
#### **Stakeholders:**  
The project benefits multiple groups including renewable energy companies seeking to improve photovoltaic efficiency, government institutions(**like EDH**) involved in energy policy, local communities(**business owner, residents,...**) aiming to access stable and clean electricity and Data Science Team responsible for data collection, analysis, model development, and system integration. The academic team is also a key stakeholder responsible for research, model development, and interpretability analysis.
    
#### **Business Problem**

The organization currently faces challenges in accurately predicting solar energy production due to fluctuating environmental conditions such as solar irradiance, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.  
This uncertainty can lead to **inefficient energy distribution**, **overreliance on backup systems**, and **financial losses**.

#### **In-Scope Problems**

-   Collecting, cleaning, and preparing environmental and production datasets.
    
-   Building and evaluating machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
    
-   Performing feature engineering to identify variables that strongly influence energy production.
    
-   Delivering visual analytics and model performance reports to support decision-making.

The dataset includes environmental and operational parameters. Using a large dataset of solar production records, the study applies machine learning techniques to uncover patterns between meteorological conditions such as irradiance, temperature, and wind and PV energy performance.
